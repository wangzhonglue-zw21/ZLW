3_way_contest: The code that compares performance of rigid mathematical regression estimation vs. intiutive verbal reasoning estimation.
Batch_prompt_improvement_Large: This code implements a self-improving AI system where a "Manager" LLM learns to predict math problem difficulty by analyzing its prediction errors, generating an optimized prediction prompt through reflection, and validating the improvement on new problems - achieving a 37.5% reduction in prediction error.
Prompt_evolution_miniature_feature_matching: The code that demonstrate the ineffectiveness of verbal learning through matching miniature/surface features(the example is about key word matching) similar to the method used in standard deep learning.
prompt_evolution_high_abstraction： used for comparison against previous code, demonstrating that for verbal reinforcement learning high level abstractions and summaries works better as parameters, a certain level of interpretation is vital to the effectiveness of learning.
prototype_token_predictor_with_confidence: A prototype code that incorporate verbal learning with standard mathematical deep learning tools for a self improving token estimator.
